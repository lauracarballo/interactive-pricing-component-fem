# Interactive Pricing Component - Frontend Mentor

I built this interactive pricing component following the Frontend Mentor design and styling guidances. 

## The challenge

The challenge is to build an interactive pricing component and get it to look as close to the [design](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8) as possible. 


The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers (details provided below)

## Technologies

React v16.13.1

## Setup

Clone this repo git clone https://github.com/lauracarballo/interactive-pricing-component-fem to your desktop and run npm install to install all the dependencies.

## To run the project

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
